  <p>Our test team have highlighted the following issues with the app:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Invoice Form</li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The client dropdown on the invoice form contains inactive clients; these
        should be filtered out
      </li>
      <li>
        The date pickers on the invoice form are not currently filtering. The
        expectation is that the receipt date should prevent dates in the future
        being selected and the due date should prevent dates in the past from
        being selected
      </li>
      <li>
        The "Invoice Amount" control on our invoice form is allowing non-numeric
        characters. This control should allow numbers only
      </li>
      <li>
        Clicking the "Reset" button on the form triggers validation for any
        controls that are reset, this should not occur
      </li>
      <li>
        Clicking the "Reset" button does not clear the selection in the "Client"
        dropdown; we would expect this control to be reset along with the others
      </li>
      <li>After a successful save, the form should reset to defaults</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Invoice List</li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The list screen is inefficient in that it loads the clients, then loads
        the invoices. If we have a delay on the client endpoint, our whole call
        is held back. Can this be refactored to fetch all the data together and
        act on it?
      </li>
    </ul>
    <li>Miscellaneous</li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The app's main content is not correctly filling the screen. Our
        expectations are that content outside of the left nav should fill the
        entire remaining screen width
      </li>
      <li>
        We have a 404 page, but it is not being hit when the user tries an
        invalid URL. Please investigate
      </li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
